How to open project

*use skin_composer.jar
*create new project
*import the json file inside 'exported' folder (file->import...)
*a folder called '<project-name>_data' will be created. Inside will be all the assets separated into different files
Now you are ready to work.

*for adding a new asset to the project, just put it inside the '<project-name>_data' folder and import through skin_composer to whatever style you need
*for compressing and exporting assets, just go to file->export.. and enter a .json filename (for emgone, 'emgone-skin.json' should be used). For clarity purposes, save it into the 'exported' folder
WARNING: it seems that the export process fails if the 'exported' folder contains older files. I prefer to delete everyting and clean the folder before exporting
