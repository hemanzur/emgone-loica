*Use TexturePacker. Only Free Version is necesary
*When exporting, a .png and a .txt file will be created
*The software is bugged sometimes. Sometimes the .txt file is generated incorrectly. For example, inside emgone-images folder, everytime the .txt file is generated, the index of the file 'Fondo_configuracion_1' is set to '1'. It should be '-1'. Everytime this set of assets is compressed you should fix this number MANUALLY.
The same thing happend with the .txt files for the loicas. Particularly the damaged loicas. The '_2' for the file names is omitted in the .txt file. Similarly, this has to be fixed manually.
